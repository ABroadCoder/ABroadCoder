    The Alamo: A Legacy of Texas
</h1>
<p>
    The Alamo is a symbol of Texas's struggle for independence from Mexico. The battle of the Alamo was a turning point in the Texas Revolution, and the bravery of the defenders of the Alamo is a source of pride for Texans.

    While not all agree with the idea that the Alamo represents a blemishless struggle for justice, all can understand that it plays a powerful role in the concept of Texas as a separate political entity at a time when it, the United States, and Mexico were all in a formative stage.
